# 7DTD-LeverAction44 Mod
A [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com/) game mod that converts the Lever Action Rifle to use .44 Magnum ammo

## Description
This mod modifies the Lever Action Rifle to use .44 Ammo instead of the default 7.62 ammo.

All item packs and quest reward bundles that give the Lever Action Rifle have
been modified to include .44 ammo instead of the 7.62 ammo.
The base damage of the Lever Action Rifle has been slightly reduced to keep it
from being too OP. The damage of an unmodded Lever Action Rifle with no associated
perks is slightly higher than when using the 7.62 ammo but slightly lower than the
comparable tier .44 handguns. No other changes have been made to the weapon.

This mod can be added to or removed from existing saves without any known critical
side effects.  It should be noted that if this mod is added to or removed from an
existing save, any existing Lever Action Rifles may lose whatever ammo is currently
loaded into them and that ammo will not be returned to the player.

## Installation
1) Copy the enclosed PlaebadLeverAction44 folder into the Mods folder in your 7 Days to Die game directory

You should end up with a path such as ```C:\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods\PlaebadLeverAction44```
